# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview
Sorting Visualizer is a web application built with Next.js and TypeScript to visualize various sorting algorithms. It helps users understand the working of different sorting techniques through animations.

## Features
- Visual representation of sorting algorithms
- Supports multiple sorting techniques
- Customizable sorting speed
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- User can select the desired sorting algorithm

## Technologies Used
- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Supported Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort

## Functionality
- Generates a random array for sorting visualization
- Allows users to choose a sorting algorithm
- Provides an option to adjust the sorting speed
- Displays a smooth animation of the sorting process

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
